# CDL CHECKOUT
This is a simple checkout system that handles pricing schemes such as "apples cost 50 pence, three apples cost Â£1.30." It allows items to be added to a basket in any order, and calculates the total price based on a set of pricing rules that can be passed in when starting a transaction.

## Example pricing rules

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Unit Price (pence)</th>
    <th>Special Price (pence)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>3 for 130</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>2 for 45</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
